Hand-draw pixmap for many different blocks (ie. 20 by 20 meter "room")
Randomly attach these blocks together to form a grid of different rooms up to a maximum size.
Pad area around larger level with black (darkness) space to prevent camera from seeing through unrendered space
This allows for psuedo-random level generation

Standard components in rooms will be unbreakable-rocks, breakable-rocks, enemies, and gold(either breakable pots or chests etc)
Some rooms will have more or less of these.
Some rooms will be special rooms and have additional components.

One random room will have a ladder placed below a breakable rock
This is how the player will progress to the next level of the dungeon.

Doors will seperate rooms and rooms will be dark until a door is opened.
After open enemies will begin to attack
