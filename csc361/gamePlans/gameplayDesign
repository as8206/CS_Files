Players will move through dungeons trying to get the highest score they can before they die.
Dungeons will have multiple levels and a final boss at the end.
Each level the player progresses through gets harder and harder.
Finishing a dungeon and moving on to the next increases difficulty more significantly than a level change within the same dungeon.
When the player dies they lose all equipment and score.

Pots and chests can be broken/opened to gain gold.
These will also contain loot such as weapons or armor.
Can rarely contain health increases

Enemies will be spawned in the rooms when they are created.
Once a door to the room is opened, the room is revealed and the enemies will begin to attack.
Killed enemies will occasionally drop power-ups. (Double score, healing, etc)

Score is gained from picking up gold as well as killing enemies.
If a dungeon is "cleared" a large score bonus is awarded.

To clear the dungeon the player must go down through all levels.
After they advance past the final level of the dungeon they will reach the boss level.
The boss level consists of only the boss enemy encounter.

After the boss is defeated, the player leaves the dungeon and can enter the next one.
