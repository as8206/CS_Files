1. Team Productivity : (josh)
	New Tests Passing - xBar and R chart w/control lines
	Package Size - cu-sum chart 
2. Quality of Software :
	Defects per Package - u chart for nonconformities per unit w/ unknown sample size (mina)
	Avg Cyclomatic Complexity - xBar and R chart w/control lines (andrew)
3. Impact of changing environment : (mina)
	
4. Does complexity predict defects : (andrew)
	Correlation tests between complexity and defects in each package
