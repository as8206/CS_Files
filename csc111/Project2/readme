Project Description: This project is to write a program to test the functionality of stackADT (textbook p500-p501) and
queueADT that implemented using linked lists. You will read data from the test.dat file.
When you read add number, the number should be inserted to both stack (push) and queue
(enqueue) named inStack and inQueue, respectively.
When you read delete, data should be deleted from both inStack (pop) and inQueue (dequeue).
Data popped from inStack should be enqueued in outQueue. Similarly, data dequeued from
inQueue should be pushed in outStack.
