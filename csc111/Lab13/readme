Project: The purpose of this lab is to create a program that take input from a user and checks for a vowel at the beginning of the string. If there is a 
vowel at the beginning, it will just add "-way" to the end and print it out.  If there is no vowel it will check for "Y" int the string as well. If there is a "y" it will add "-ay" at the end of the string. If there are no vowels at all it will return the string with "-way" at the end.
