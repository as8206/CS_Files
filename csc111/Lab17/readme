Project description: This is a program that will uses a set algorithm to test and find all of the answers to the 12 coin question. Each coin has a value 1 - 12 and must be put into two groups, one of 4 and one of 8 that must have 2 prime numbers. The summation of the group of 4 times 2 must be equal to the summation of the group of 8.

Testing enviroment: linux

Files included:
   Source code: lab17.c
   Additional: readme

How to compile: type "make lab17"

How to run: type "/lab17"

Known bugs: Though I think my algorithm will work to print the results, I was getting a weird error I couldn't solve within the time.
