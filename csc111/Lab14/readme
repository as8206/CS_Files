Program description: As part of the new educational reform program, the CS department has decided to engage in censorship of school texts. In this problem, you must help the department by writing a program which eliminates from an input text string all occurrences of strings from a set of words to be filtered. More formally, a word w can be removed from another string s if w is a substring of s (i.e., the characters of w appear consecutively in s). Given a text string s and a set T of words to be filtered, return the length of the shortest possible string that can result from iteratively removing words in T from s. Each word in T may be removed from s an unlimited number of times.
