Program Description: Includes four programs. 
   p455n15.c is a program that will use a pointer to a function to loop a call to a function to determine when an equation returns true. 
   p455n16.c is a program that will request 2 numbers, the second one larger than the first. It will then calculate the sum of 2x+3 (x being the input) from the initial input to the second input.
   qsort is a program that takes 10 integers from the user and sorts them using the quick sort algorithm. This version uses arrays.
   qsort2 is a program that also takes 10 intergers from the user and sorts them using the quick sort algorith. However, this version uses pointers.
