In SkinPicker, the crew is reset when the ScreenMap is rebuilt but the skin itself never is.
Because the getCrewSkin checks for null before changing color, if this has already but initialized as a different player the skin is never reset.
You can fix this by assigning the skin inside setCrew.
The null check can still be left inside getCrewSkin as a backup just in case something goes wrong and skin is null
